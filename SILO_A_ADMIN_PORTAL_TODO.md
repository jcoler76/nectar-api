# SILO A: Platform Admin Portal - Implementation TODO

## üéØ Current Status
- ‚úÖ Admin backend infrastructure exists with TypeScript/Express/Prisma
- ‚úÖ Analytics controller and service implemented
- ‚úÖ Authentication and audit logging working
- ‚ùå Missing critical database models for revenue tracking
- ‚ùå Frontend dashboard components need implementation

---

## üìã Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Database Schema Completion ‚úÖ 
- [x] **Add missing analytics models to admin backend schema**
  - [x] Add `RevenueMetric` model for time-series revenue data
  - [x] Add `BillingEvent` model for detailed billing activity tracking  
  - [x] Add customer models (`Organization`, `User`, `Subscription`, `Membership`) to admin backend schema
  - [x] Add `monthlyRevenue` and `cancelAtPeriodEnd` fields to `Subscription` model
  - [ ] Generate Prisma client for admin backend (blocked by running processes)
  - [ ] Add missing fields to customer database schema (`monthlyRevenue`, `cancelAtPeriodEnd`)

- [ ] **Create data population scripts**
  - [ ] Script to backfill `RevenueMetric` from existing subscription data
  - [ ] Script to populate initial billing events from Stripe
  - [ ] Background job for ongoing revenue metric calculations

### ‚úÖ **ARCHITECTURE ISSUE RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Admin backend analytics service tries to query customer data, but they are separate databases!

**Current State**:
- **Admin Backend DB** (`admin-backend/prisma`): PlatformAdmin, AdminAuditLog, SystemConfig  
- **Customer Database** (`server/prisma`): Organization, User, Subscription (has the data we need)
- **Analytics Service**: References models like `revenueMetric` and `billingEvent` that don't exist

**Solution**: Configure admin backend with **dual database connections**:
1. **Admin DB**: For admin-specific data (existing)
2. **Customer DB**: For analytics queries (new connection needed)

**Next Steps**:
1. Add customer database connection to admin backend
2. Create analytics models in customer database (add missing models)
3. Update analytics service to use customer database connection
4. Keep admin data separate in admin database

### Phase 2: Analytics Service Integration
- [ ] **Fix analytics service database references**
  - [ ] Update database connection to use customer DB for analytics
  - [ ] Test all analytics endpoints with real data
  - [ ] Verify Stripe service integration

- [ ] **Stripe webhook integration**
  - [ ] Set up webhook endpoints for real-time billing events
  - [ ] Implement automatic revenue metric updates
  - [ ] Add webhook security validation

### Phase 3: Frontend Dashboard Implementation
- [ ] **Executive Dashboard**
  - [ ] Revenue overview cards (MRR, ARR, Growth Rate)
  - [ ] Interactive revenue charts over time
  - [ ] Churn rate and health score displays
  - [ ] Top customers table

- [ ] **Financial Analytics Dashboard**
  - [ ] Revenue breakdown by subscription plans
  - [ ] Payment success/failure rate charts
  - [ ] Upcoming renewals calendar view
  - [ ] Geographic revenue distribution

- [ ] **Customer Management Dashboard**
  - [ ] Organization search and filtering
  - [ ] User activity and engagement metrics
  - [ ] Trial-to-paid conversion tracking
  - [ ] Customer health scoring

### Phase 4: Operational Features
- [ ] **System monitoring integration**
  - [ ] Database performance metrics
  - [ ] API response time tracking
  - [ ] Error rate monitoring

- [ ] **Admin user management**
  - [ ] Admin user creation and role management
  - [ ] Session management and security
  - [ ] Audit log viewing and filtering

- [ ] **Configuration management**
  - [ ] System-wide configuration editor
  - [ ] Feature flag management
  - [ ] Notification settings

## üöß Immediate Priorities

### **URGENT - Database Models (Blocking)**
The analytics service cannot function without these models:

1. **RevenueMetric Model** - Add to `server/prisma/schema.prisma`
2. **BillingEvent Model** - Add to `server/prisma/schema.prisma` 
3. **Update Subscription Model** - Add `monthlyRevenue` field

### **HIGH - Data Population**
Need historical data to make reports meaningful:

1. Backfill revenue metrics from existing subscriptions
2. Import billing history from Stripe
3. Set up automated daily/monthly metric calculations

### **MEDIUM - Frontend Implementation**
Once data is available, implement dashboards:

1. Start with Executive Dashboard (highest business value)
2. Add Financial Analytics for revenue deep-dives
3. Build Customer Management tools

---

## üìä Expected Reporting Capabilities

### **Revenue Analytics**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) trends
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) projections
- Revenue growth rates and forecasting
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

### **Customer Analytics** 
- Organization growth and churn rates
- User engagement and feature adoption
- Trial conversion rates
- Geographic distribution
- Customer health scoring

### **Financial Operations**
- Payment processing success rates
- Billing event tracking and troubleshooting
- Subscription lifecycle management
- Revenue recognition and reporting

### **Platform Health**
- System performance monitoring
- API usage and rate limiting
- Database performance metrics
- Error tracking and alerting

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Considerations

### **Database Architecture**
- Admin portal uses separate database from customer data
- Analytics service needs cross-database queries
- Consider read-replicas for heavy reporting queries

### **Security & Access Control**
- Role-based access to sensitive financial data
- Audit logging for all admin actions
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication

### **Performance Optimization**
- Cache frequently accessed metrics
- Optimize complex aggregation queries
- Consider background jobs for heavy calculations

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

### **Technical Goals**
- [ ] All analytics endpoints return real data
- [ ] Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for admin portal
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging

### **Business Goals**  
- [ ] Complete visibility into revenue trends
- [ ] Actionable insights for customer success
- [ ] Automated alerting for critical metrics
- [ ] Executive-ready reporting capabilities
