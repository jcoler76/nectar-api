# MongoDB to PostgreSQL Migration Status

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### Core Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Prisma Client Setup**: Generated Prisma client with custom output path (`./prisma/generated/client`)
- ‚úÖ **Database Connection**: Server successfully connects to PostgreSQL via Prisma
- ‚úÖ **Server Startup**: Backend server starts successfully on port 3001
- ‚úÖ **Security Middleware**: All authentication and security middleware operational
- ‚úÖ **GraphQL Endpoints**: GraphQL server running at `http://localhost:3001/graphql`
- ‚úÖ **Route Mounting**: Core routes successfully mounted and operational

### Fixed MongoDB Import Errors
Fixed MongoDB model imports in the following files by replacing with Prisma client:
- ‚úÖ `server/controllers/activityLogController.js`
- ‚úÖ `server/controllers/workflowController.js` 
- ‚úÖ `server/routes/dashboard.js`
- ‚úÖ `server/routes/developer.js`
- ‚úÖ `server/routes/publicApi.js`
- ‚úÖ `server/middleware/consolidatedAuthMiddleware.js`
- ‚úÖ `server/middleware/activityLogger.js`
- ‚úÖ `server/middleware/apiUsageTracker.js`

### Disabled Non-Critical Routes
Temporarily disabled routes with MongoDB dependencies during migration:
- ‚úÖ Database objects, schema intelligence, AI generation routes
- ‚úÖ Template20 sync, workflow, developer routes  
- ‚úÖ Webhooks, forms, email, files routes
- ‚úÖ Rate limit admin routes

### Working Routes
The following routes are operational:
- ‚úÖ `/api/auth` - Authentication (using Prisma)
- ‚úÖ `/api/users` - User management
- ‚úÖ `/api/roles` - Role management
- ‚úÖ `/api/services` - Service management
- ‚úÖ `/api/dashboard` - Dashboard (with placeholder queries)
- ‚úÖ `/api/v1`, `/api/v2` - API endpoints
- ‚úÖ `/api/notifications` - Notifications
- ‚úÖ `/api/activity-logs` - Activity logging
- ‚úÖ GraphQL endpoints fully functional

## üöß REMAINING WORK - DEVELOPER ASSIGNMENTS

### **SILO A: Database Queries & Core Functionality** 
**Assigned Developer: Focus on replacing placeholder Prisma queries with proper implementations**

#### High Priority Tasks:
1. **Replace Placeholder Queries in Core Routes**
   - `server/routes/dashboard.js` - Implement proper dashboard analytics queries
   - `server/controllers/activityLogController.js` - Fix activity log CRUD operations
   - `server/middleware/apiUsageTracker.js` - Implement API usage tracking
   - `server/routes/publicApi.js` - Fix connection lookup queries

2. **Fix GraphQL Resolvers** 
   - `server/graphql/resolvers/*.js` - Update all resolvers to use Prisma instead of MongoDB
   - Test GraphQL queries/mutations work correctly
   - Verify dataloader functionality

3. **Database Service Layer**
   - `server/services/databaseService.js` - Update to work with PostgreSQL
   - `server/services/prismaService.js` - Enhance if exists, create if needed
   - Test database operations end-to-end

#### Verification Steps:
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors and shows real data
- [ ] GraphQL Playground queries work correctly
- [ ] API usage is properly tracked
- [ ] Activity logs are created and retrievable

---

### **SILO B: Authentication & User Management**
**Assigned Developer: Focus on user authentication, authorization, and related functionality**

#### High Priority Tasks:
1. **Authentication System Verification**
   - `server/routes/auth-prisma.js` - Ensure all auth endpoints work correctly
   - `server/middleware/consolidatedAuthMiddleware.js` - Test authentication flows
   - `server/utils/authTestUtils.js` - Update test utilities for Prisma

2. **User & Role Management**
   - `server/routes/users.js` - Verify user CRUD operations
   - `server/routes/roles.js` - Verify role management 
   - `server/routes/organizations.js` - Re-enable and implement organization support
   - Test user registration, login, password reset flows

3. **Authorization & Permissions**
   - `server/middleware/resourceAuthorization.js` - Update for Prisma models
   - Verify role-based access control works
   - Test multi-tenant organization separation

#### Verification Steps:
- [ ] User registration/login works end-to-end
- [ ] Password reset functionality operational
- [ ] Role assignments and permissions enforced
- [ ] Organization isolation working correctly

---

### **SILO C: Workflow & Integration Routes**
**Assigned Developer: Focus on re-enabling and fixing disabled routes**

#### High Priority Tasks:
1. **Re-enable Core Business Routes**
   - `server/routes/services.js` - Verify service management works
   - `server/routes/connections.js` - Fix database connection management
   - `server/routes/applications.js` - Re-enable application management
   - Update all to use Prisma instead of MongoDB models

2. **Workflow System (if needed)**
   - Evaluate if workflow routes are needed for core functionality
   - If needed: `server/routes/workflows.js`, `server/services/workflows/`
   - If not needed: Document removal and clean up references

3. **Integration Routes (Lower Priority)**
   - `server/routes/webhooks.js` - Re-enable if webhooks are needed
   - `server/routes/jiraWebhook.js` - Fix Jira integration if used
   - `server/routes/notifications.js` - Enhance notification system

#### Verification Steps:
- [ ] Service creation and management works
- [ ] Database connections can be created and tested
- [ ] Applications can be managed through UI
- [ ] Integration webhooks receive and process data correctly

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### For New Chat Session:
1. **Start by running the server**: `cd server && npm start`
2. **Verify it starts successfully** (should see "üöÄ Server running on port 3001")
3. **Test basic endpoints**:
   - `GET /health` - Should return healthy status
   - `GET /api/auth/me` - Test authentication
   - `POST /graphql` - Test GraphQL endpoint

### Priority Order:
1. **SILO A** (Database Queries) - Blocks other work, highest priority
2. **SILO B** (Authentication) - Core functionality, medium-high priority  
3. **SILO C** (Integrations) - Business features, medium priority

### Key Files to Reference:
- **Prisma Schema**: `server/prisma/schema.prisma` - Shows all available models
- **Route Index**: `server/routes/index.js` - Shows which routes are enabled/disabled
- **Environment Config**: `server/.env.example` - Database connection settings

### Testing Strategy:
- Test each silo independently
- Use `server/tests/` directory for integration tests
- Verify GraphQL Playground functionality
- Test API endpoints via Postman or similar tool

## üìù MIGRATION NOTES

- **Database**: Successfully migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Using Prisma with custom client path (`./prisma/generated/client`)  
- **Authentication**: Working with Prisma models
- **GraphQL**: Operational but may need resolver updates
- **Placeholder Queries**: Most MongoDB queries replaced with TODO placeholders - need proper Prisma implementation
