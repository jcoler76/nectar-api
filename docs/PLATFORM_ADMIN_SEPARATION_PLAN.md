# Platform Admin Separation Plan

## 🎯 **Overview**

This document outlines the architectural separation of the Nectar platform into two distinct applications:

1. **Platform Admin Portal** - Internal platform management (admin.nectarstudio.ai)
2. **Customer SaaS Application** - Customer-facing product (app.nectar.com)

This separation follows industry best practices for multi-tenant SaaS platforms and provides better security, scalability, and maintainability.

## 📝 **Migration Strategy**

1. **Parallel Development**: Build new platform admin while existing system runs
2. **Feature Flagging**: Gradually move features between applications
3. **Data Migration**: Migrate existing admin users to platform admin system
4. **DNS Cutover**: Switch domains when both applications are ready
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor both systems during transition period
6. **Rollback Plan**: Keep ability to rollback to unified system if needed

---

## 🔒 **Security Considerations**

- **Network Isolation**: Platform admin on separate network/VPC
- **Database Access**: Different database users for each application  
- **API Security**: Separate API keys and rate limiting policies
- **Audit Logging**: Track all cross-application data access
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Implement least-privilege access principles

---

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

- **Performance**: Page load times < 2s for both applications
- **Security**: Zero cross-tenant data leaks
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for both applications
- **Developer Experience**: Reduced complexity in customer app codebase
- **Customer Experience**: Improved customer onboarding and feature usage
