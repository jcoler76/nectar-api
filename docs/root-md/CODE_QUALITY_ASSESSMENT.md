## Code Examples

### Before/After: TypeScript Improvement
**Before (Grade: D):**
```javascript
// server/services/workflows/nodes/approval.ts
export const execute = async (config: ApprovalConfig, context: any) => {
  const update = (patch: any) => onChange({ ...data, ...patch });
  // Type safety lost with 'any'
}
```

**After (Grade: A):**
```typescript
interface WorkflowContext {
  runId: ObjectId;
  workflowId: ObjectId;
  currentNodeId: string;
  data: Record<string, unknown>;
}

interface ApprovalPatch {
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
  approvedBy?: string;
  comments?: string;
}

export const execute = async (
  config: ApprovalConfig, 
  context: WorkflowContext
): Promise<ApprovalResult> => {
  const update = (patch: ApprovalPatch) => 
    onChange({ ...data, ...patch });
  // Full type safety maintained
}
```

### Before/After: Code Splitting
**Before (Grade: C):**
```javascript
// src/App.jsx
import Dashboard from './components/dashboard/Dashboard';
import WorkflowBuilder from './features/workflows/WorkflowBuilder';
import Reports from './components/reports/Reports';
// All components loaded synchronously
```

**After (Grade: A):**
```javascript
// src/App.jsx
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./components/dashboard/Dashboard'));
const WorkflowBuilder = lazy(() => import('./features/workflows/WorkflowBuilder'));
const Reports = lazy(() => import('./components/reports/Reports'));

// Components loaded on-demand with code splitting
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
  </Routes>
</Suspense>
```

### Before/After: Error Handling
**Before (Grade: C):**
```javascript
// server/routes/connections.js
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // ... operation
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ 
      error: error.message 
    });
  }
});
```

**After (Grade: A):**
```javascript
// server/routes/connections.js
router.post('/', validate(connectionSchema), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // ... operation
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Connection creation failed', {
      error,
      userId: req.user?.userId,
      operation: 'connection-create'
    });
    return errorResponses.serverError(res, error);
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

The Mirabel API demonstrates **strong architectural foundations** with excellent security practices and sophisticated patterns in several areas. However, the codebase requires immediate attention in **testing coverage (2%)**, **TypeScript adoption**, and **performance optimization** to reach production-grade quality.

The recommended phased approach prioritizes critical issues while maintaining development velocity. Quick wins can provide immediate improvements, while the long-term roadmap addresses fundamental quality improvements.

**Estimated Total Improvement Time:** 342 hours (~8.5 weeks of focused development)
**Expected Grade After Implementation:** A-
