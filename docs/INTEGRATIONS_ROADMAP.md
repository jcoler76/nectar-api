## Notes

- Each integration should be developed as an independent, pluggable module
- Use a common integration framework/SDK to reduce code duplication
- Maintain separate documentation for each integration with setup guides
- Consider building an "Integration Marketplace" UI for customers to browse and enable integrations
- Implement integration health monitoring and status page
- Plan for webhook signature verification for all inbound webhooks
- Consider rate limiting and cost implications of API usage
- Build integration testing suite with mock API responses
- Create integration templates for faster development of similar integrations
