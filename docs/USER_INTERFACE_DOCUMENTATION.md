### Best Practices & Usage Guidelines

#### Workflow Design
1. Use descriptive names that clearly indicate workflow purpose
2. Start with simple workflows and add complexity gradually
3. Test workflows thoroughly before activating in production
4. Document workflow logic and business requirements
5. Design for failure with appropriate error handling

#### Organization & Management
1. Group related workflows with consistent naming conventions
2. Use duplication to create workflow variants safely
3. Deactivate workflows temporarily rather than deleting when possible
4. Regularly review and update workflows for changing requirements
5. Monitor execution patterns and optimize performance

#### Security & Compliance
1. Limit workflow access to authorized users only
2. Audit workflow changes and execution history
3. Ensure data handling complies with privacy requirements
4. Use secure authentication for external system connections
5. Monitor workflow execution for unusual patterns
