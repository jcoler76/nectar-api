# üöÄ Production Testing Plan - Complete Test Case Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive test cases for validating production readiness across three critical areas:
1. **Organization Data Isolation** - Zero data leakage between organizations
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Proper permission enforcement
3. **Subscription Plan Limits** - Plan feature and limit enforcement

Each section is designed to be assigned to separate AI agents for parallel testing.

# üì¶ SECTION 1: ORGANIZATION DATA ISOLATION TESTING

## Objective

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Create 3 test organizations
Organization A: "Alpha Corp" (ID: org_alpha_test)
Organization B: "Beta Industries" (ID: org_beta_test)
Organization C: "Gamma Enterprises" (ID: org_gamma_test)

# Create users for each organization
Org A Users:
- alice@alpha.com (OWNER)
- alice-admin@alpha.com (ADMIN)
- alice-member@alpha.com (MEMBER)

Org B Users:
- bob@beta.com (OWNER)
- bob-admin@beta.com (ADMIN)
- bob-member@beta.com (MEMBER)

Org C Users:
- charlie@gamma.com (OWNER)
- charlie-admin@gamma.com (ADMIN)
- charlie-member@gamma.com (MEMBER)
```

### Test Data Setup
For EACH organization, create:
- 3 database connections (different names/hosts)
- 5 services
- 3 applications with API keys
- 10 workflows
- 5 endpoints
- 3 roles
- 2 API keys
- 10 API activity logs
- 5 audit logs
- 3 notifications
- 2 webhooks
- 5 file storage items

**Report Format**:
```
Role Tested | Permission | Expected | Actual | Status
VIEWER      | Create API | DENY     | DENY   | PASS
```

### Agent 3: Plan Limits Testing
**Assignment**: Execute all TC-PLAN-* test cases (Section 3)

# üìä FINAL DELIVERABLES

Each AI agent should deliver:

1. **Test Execution Report** (CSV/JSON format)
2. **Failed Test Details** (with screenshots/logs)
3. **Security Findings** (any vulnerabilities found)
4. **Performance Metrics** (response times, query counts)
5. **Recommendations** (fixes needed before production)

## Report Template
```markdown
